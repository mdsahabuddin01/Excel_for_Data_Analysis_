This project involved creating an interactive coffee sales dashboard in Excel using data from a fictional dataset.
The dashboard aimed to provide insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance.



Data Gathering: Collected data from multiple tables (orders, customers, products) using XLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH formulas.
Data Cleaning and Formatting: Standardized data formats, cleaned missing values, and created calculated fields (e.g., total sales).
Pivot Table Creation: Built pivot tables to analyze sales data by coffee type, country, customer, and other relevant factors.
Chart Creation: Developed line charts, bar charts, and slicers to visualize sales trends and customer preferences.
Dashboard Design: Combined multiple pivot charts and slicers into a cohesive dashboard for interactive analysis.
Findings:

Top-selling coffee types: Identified the most popular coffee types based on sales volume.
Customer preferences: Analyzed customer preferences for different coffee types, roast types, and sizes.
Sales trends: Observed sales trends over time, including seasonal variations and peak sales periods.
Customer loyalty: Evaluated the impact of loyalty cards on customer purchasing behavior.
Country-specific analysis: Compared sales performance across different countries.
Conclusion:

The coffee sales dashboard provides valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity.
This information can be used to optimize marketing strategies, improve inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction.
